# Allstate-insurance-claim-severity
These scripts were created as a part of a Kaggle competition "Allstate Claims Severity". Allstate was developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this recruitment challenge, Kagglers were invited to show off their creativity and flex their technical chops by creating an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity.
